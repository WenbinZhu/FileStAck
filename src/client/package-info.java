/** Client library.

    <p>
    The client library provides the convenience classes
    <code>DFSInputStream</code> and <code>DFSOutputStream</code>, which are
    derived from <code>InputStream</code> and <code>OutputStream</code>,
    respectively. The two classes permit files in the distributed fileystem to
    be accessed as regular Java streams. For example, a file can be read by a
    <code>BufferedReader</code> or a <code>Scanner</code> by constructing those
    from a <code>DFSInputStream</code>.
