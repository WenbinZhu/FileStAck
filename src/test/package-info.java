/** Testing library.

    <p>
    The testing library provides the base class <code>Test</code>, which
    simplifies the writing of multithreaded tests with timeout. It also provides
    the <code>Series</code> class for creating and running test series.

    <p>
    The library itself may be tested using the <code>SelfTest</code> class.
