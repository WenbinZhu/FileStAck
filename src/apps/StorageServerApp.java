/** Storage server application.

    <p>
    The storage server application expects three arguments: in order, the
    local hostname, the hostname of the remote naming server, and the directory
    that the storage server will use as its local storage for files.

    <p>
    The directory can be given as an absolute or a relative path. The current
    contents of the directory will be offered to the naming server during
    registration. Duplicate files in the directory will be deleted, and empty
    directories will be pruned.

    <p>
    For this reason, it is <em>extremely</em> important that the storage server
    not be started in a directory containing important files, as those files may
    be deleted. It is recommended that a special directory be created for each
    storage server, and the storage server only be started in that directory.

    <p>
    The user under which the storage server is run should have full read and
    write access to the directory in which the storage server is started.
